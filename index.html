<p>Web users consume media; we choose which books to download, which news
articles to read, and which movies to watch. In the past, we often found
media by asking trusted friends for recommendations.  In the modern
web, however, we rely more on algorithmic preference-based
recommendation models to find media we are likely to enjoy.
Preference-based recommendation systems have transformed how we
consume media; these methods uncover our latent preferences from usage
data and form recommendations based on the behavior of others with
similar tastes.</p>
<p>
But preference-based recommendations focuses us and reinforces our
preferences, losing the social aspect of consumption where a trusted
friend might point us to an interesting item that does not match our
typical preferences.  In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between
preference- and social-based recommendations.  We exploit that our
social structure&mdash;that is, the friends and colleagues from whom we
might enjoy recommendations&mdash;is often encoded on the same platform
as the one which we use to find media.  This opens the door to using
the preferences and histories of users we know to inform algorithmic
recommendations.</p>
<p>Specifically, we have developed a
probabilistic model that incorporates social network information into
traditional recommendation models, reintroducing the social aspect to
recommendation and improving recommendations.</p>

<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h3>

<ol>
<li>Prepare data.  The format used for ratings is one set of <code>user,item,rating</code> per line, tab separated.  Network file should also be tab separated, one pair of <code>user,friend</code> per line.  Ratings should be split into train, test, and validation sets, named accordingly.</li>
<li>Clone the repo: </br><code> git clone https://github.com/ajbc/spf.git</code></li>
<li>Navigate to the <code>spf/src</code> directory</li>
<li>Compile by running <code>make</code></li>
<li>Run the executable (see <code>README</code> for full options), e.g.:</br><code>./spf --data ~/my-data/ --out my-fit</code></li>
</ol>
